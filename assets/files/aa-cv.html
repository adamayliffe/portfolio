INTERESTS
My passion is technology and has been from a young age. I like to tinker around with my laptop and
am currently designing my own network at home. I am looking to install new cabling and have
identified ideal access points through my house so I can get a solid connection throughout.

I am currently building my own websites, this is now my passion coding. I am able to code in HTML and CSS.
