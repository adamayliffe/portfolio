        <h2>About project</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            This project was all about upgrading an internal cloud based phone system <br>
            This is using the platform called 3CX <b>Phone System</b> | Video | Chat <br>
            
        </p>
        <h2>Deployment method</h2>
        <p>
            <h3>Who are 3CX ?</h3>
            3CX are a VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) company who have designed a unique cloud based PBX phone system <br>
            To read more why don't you visit their website <a href="https://www.3cx.com">www.3cx.com</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>What did I Deploy ?</h3>
            I deployed an upgraded version of the current 3CX VoIP phone system 
            <h3>How did I deploy it ?</h3>
            It now has more enhanced security using MFA (MultiFactor Authentication) on all users to login to the phone platform<br>
            It now has three call queue groups for 1st line, 2nd line and 3rd line support engineers this has been setup <br>
            It has a ring group for out of hours clients to call the 24/7 support desk, this now connects back to the standard working hours phone call queue which belongs to the 1st line support desk <br>
            With that I've connected up a OOH message for anyone who calls the in hours number after 6pm to the main DDI. 
        </p>
